# Skills Gap Data Analytics


## Files/Datasets: ##

**Workforce_Skills_Gap_Analysis.csv**
   
This dataset examines the workforce skills gap from 2019 to 2023 across various industries in ten countries. It includes data on critical skill shortages, employees needing reskilling, in-demand skills, training costs, and the financial impact of skill gaps. The information is aimed at analyzing trends, identifying skill shortages, and facilitating the planning of training programs to address these gaps effectively. 


## Analytics Objectives: ##

**Workforce Development/Reskilling Strategy:** Identify the industries and countries with the highest critical skill shortage percentage to develop targeted training programs.

*<ins>Based on the data analysis:<ins>*

The industries with the highest critical skill shortage percentages are Transportation and Finance in Canada, both at 25%.

The Retail industry in the UK closely follows with a 24% shortage.

In the USA, both the Retail and Manufacturing industries have a 23% critical skill shortage.

The Technology industry also shows significant skill shortages, with 22% in both the USA and Japan.

These insights suggest that targeted training programs should prioritize these industries and countries to address the most severe skill shortages.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Determine the financial impact of skill shortage and compare it with the average training cost per employee for a cost-effective reskilling strategy.

*<ins>Based on the visualization above:<ins>*
The data analysis reveals a consistent negative financial impact due to skill shortage over the years, with an average net impact of approximately -784.5 USD Million per year. This consistent negative trajectory suggests a significant cost associated with skill shortage.

In 2019, the net financial impact was -806.60175 USD Million.

In 2020, it slightly decreased to -801.146667 USD Million.

A further decrease was observed in 2021 with -760.5975 USD Million.

However, the highest financial impact was seen in 2022 with -876.2715 USD Million.

*In 2023, the impact reduced significantly to -677.707556 USD Million.*

Comparing these figures with the average training cost per employee could provide insights for a more cost-effective reskilling strategy.

*<ins>The data reveals a substantial skills gap in the global workforce, with varying degrees of impact across different countries.</ins>*

Canada appears most affected, needing reskilling for roughly 3,050 thousand employees.

Japan and the UK follow closely with 2,085 and 1,919 thousand respectively.

On the other hand, India and Germany show the least demand for reskilling, with only 678 and 847 thousand employees respectively.

Notably, despite having the largest population, China's reskilling needs are relatively low at 1,114 thousand.

This suggests that international efforts and strategies should primarily target Canada, Japan, and the UK to effectively address the global workforce skills gap.
