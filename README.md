*Critical Skill Shortage for USA

<img width="582" alt="Critical Skill Shortage_USA" src="https://github.com/sikoh/Data-Analytics-with-Skills.AI/assets/84741857/bc4b4564-763a-4c68-b71b-b74b05f3ce6c">

*<ins>Based on the data analysis:<ins>*

The industries with the highest critical skill shortage percentages are Transportation and Finance in Canada, both at 25%.

The Retail industry in the UK closely follows with a 24% shortage.

In the USA, both the Retail and Manufacturing industries have a 23% critical skill shortage.

The Technology industry also shows significant skill shortages, with 22% in both the USA and Japan.

These insights suggest that targeted training programs should prioritize these industries and countries to address the most severe skill shortages.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Determine the financial impact of skill shortage and compare it with the average training cost per employee for a cost-effective reskilling strategy.
<img width="1053" alt="Net_Financial_Impact_Million_USD" src="https://github.com/sikoh/Data-Analytics-with-Skills.AI/assets/84741857/cb77eb75-841a-4354-8d27-d03961b2b7b4">
*<ins>Based on the visualization above:<ins>*
The data analysis reveals a consistent negative financial impact due to skill shortage over the years, with an average net impact of approximately -784.5 USD Million per year. This consistent negative trajectory suggests a significant cost associated with skill shortage.

In 2019, the net financial impact was -806.60175 USD Million.

In 2020, it slightly decreased to -801.146667 USD Million.

A further decrease was observed in 2021 with -760.5975 USD Million.

However, the highest financial impact was seen in 2022 with -876.2715 USD Million.

*In 2023, the impact reduced significantly to -677.707556 USD Million.*

Comparing these figures with the average training cost per employee could provide insights for a more cost-effective reskilling strategy.

*<ins>The data indicates a strong future demand in the following areas:</ins>*

Sales and Customer Management tops the list with 1484 thousand employees needing reskilling, suggesting a critical need for sales skills and customer handling capabilities.

Healthcare Expertise is the second most demanded skill with 1375 thousand employees requiring reskilling, indicating a growing need in the healthcare industry.

Data Analysis and Cloud Computing are also in high demand, with 907 and 800 thousand employees needing training, respectively, pointing towards the ongoing digital transformation in businesses.

Lower on the list but still significant, AI and Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity indicate emerging tech fields where future workforce needs are likely to increase, with 444 and 232 thousand employees needing reskilling respectively.
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Industry Analysis:** Identify the industry with the most employees needing reskilling to prioritize the sectors that require immediate intervention.
<img width="1053" alt="Employees_Needing_Reskilling" src="https://github.com/sikoh/Data-Analytics-with-Skills.AI/assets/84741857/6039dfcb-6470-47bb-b382-40d42c17e69d">
*<ins>The analysis of employee reskilling needs across various industries revealed:</ins>*

Retail stands as the top priority sector with 3261 thousand employees needing reskilling.

The Finance industry follows with 1879 thousand employees.

Energy and Construction are closely aligned, requiring reskilling for 1457 thousand and 1435 thousand employees respectively.

The Technology industry has the least demand in this context with 1314 thousand employees.

These results suggest an immediate focus on the retail sector for intervention strategies.
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Country Profiling:** Determine which countries are most affected by the workforce skills gap to focus international efforts and strategies.
<img width="1079" alt="Workforce_skills_gap" src="https://github.com/sikoh/Data-Analytics-with-Skills.AI/assets/84741857/7e32f6e7-b49d-41ce-a8d4-b6fb7b072b51">

*<ins>The data reveals a substantial skills gap in the global workforce, with varying degrees of impact across different countries.</ins>*

Canada appears most affected, needing reskilling for roughly 3,050 thousand employees.

Japan and the UK follow closely with 2,085 and 1,919 thousand respectively.

On the other hand, India and Germany show the least demand for reskilling, with only 678 and 847 thousand employees respectively.

Notably, despite having the largest population, China's reskilling needs are relatively low at 1,114 thousand.

This suggests that international efforts and strategies should primarily target Canada, Japan, and the UK to effectively address the global workforce skills gap.
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Training Evaluation:** Evaluate the effectiveness of reskilling by comparing the business impact of skill shortage before and after training to measure return on investment.

*<ins>The analytics task reveals the following:</ins>*

Australia experienced a significant increase in business impact after training, going from 63.0 to 235.5, and a decrease in average training cost, resulting in a ROI of 0.038453.

A similar pattern is observed in Canada, with the business impact more than doubling and a ROI of 0.136585.

China and the UK saw a decrease in business impact post-training, while the training cost increased, resulting in a negative ROI.
